> CAYA - Come As You Are

First and foremost, welcome to the house! I cannot wait to meet you all more formally, but for now, as tech companies are going remote, so are we!

This might not be your normal sig venue, but don't think any less of it, you know what happens if you do.

## Requirements

In order to begin your journey you first must install `git` on your computer. Follow the instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to do so.

You will also need `npm` installed globally on your computer. This is super simple, and you can find instructions [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) for windows and mac.

## Setup

The next step is installing this repository on your computer. Run the following command in your terminal/command line:

```
git clone https://github.com/benj2468/sigs
```

If this doesn't work, you most likely recently upgraded your OS Big Sur - So fucked... /s Run the following and try again:

```
xcode-select --install
```

Now, enter into this git repositories directory with the following command:

```
cd sigs
```

## Running

Now embark on your journey. Run the simple command:

```
npm ci && npm start
```
